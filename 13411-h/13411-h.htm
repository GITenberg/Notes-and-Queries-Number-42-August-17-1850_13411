<h2>NOTES</h2>
<h3>ALFRED'S OROSIUS.</h3>
<p>The two exceedingly valuable elucidations which the geography of
King Alfred relating to Germany (intercalated in the royal author's
translation of Orosius), has received from your learned
contributors MR. R.T. HAMPSON (Vol. i., p. 257.) and MR. S.W.
SINGER (Vol. i., p. 313.) induce me to offer some new views on the
same subject. From my having passed a long series of years in the
countries described, and read and examined all that continental
authors, as well as Englishmen, have written or conjectured on the
subject, I trust that my opinions, though differing from all
hitherto received, may not be unworthy the attention of these
gentlemen, and of your other numerous subscribers. I shall,
however, at present, not to exceed the necessary limitation of your
articles, restrict myself to a consideration of the very disputed
<i>Cwenas</i> and the <i>Cwen-sae</i>, which both the gentlemen
have not alluded to.</p>
<p>The universal agreement amongst the commentators (with the two
solitary exceptions I shall hereafter mention), by which this sea
is taken for the White Sea, is diverting, and has been the primary
source of many of their errors, and of that most monster one, by
which Othere's narrative has been made the relation of a voyage
round the North Cape to Archangel. It is difficult to say who may
have first broached the brilliant idea. Spelmann's annotators, his
alumni Oxonienses of University College, seem to have left the
matter without much consideration, in which they were pretty
servilely followed by Buss&aelig;us, though not so much so as to
justify Professor Ingram's remark, "that his notes were chiefly
extracted thence." (Pref. viii.) Professor Murray of G&ouml;ttingen
(1765), and Langebeck, in his <i>Scriptores Rerum Danicarum</i>
(1773), make no mention of these arctic discoveries; and the latter
is satisfied that the Cwenas are the Amazons of Adam of
Bremen:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"De Quenorum priscis Sedibus et Quenlandi&aelig; situ, vide
Torf&aelig;us, <i>Hist. Norweg.</i> i. 140. Adamus Bremens, pp. 58,
59. 61., per Amazones et terram Foeminarum voluit Queuones et
Quenladiam intelligi."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and it remains, therefore, to the next commentator, John
Reinhold Forster (the companion navigator with Sir Joseph Banks),
to have been the first to whom we owe the important error. He was
praised by Daines Barrington, for whose edition he gave the notes
afterwards reproduced in his <i>Northern Voyages of Discovery</i>;
but still with certain reservations. The honourable translator
found some negative evidences which seemed to militate against the
idea that the voyage could have extended into the arctic circle;
for, in such a case, Othere would hardly have refrained from
mentioning the perpetual day of those regions; the northern lights,
which he must have experienced; to which <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page178" id="page178"></a>{178}</span> we add,
the perpetual snows, and many other very striking peculiarities, so
new and seemingly inexplicable to a southern traveller or
listener.</p>
<p>Succeeding writers seem to have had fewer scruples, and to have
admitted the idea without consideration. Thorkelin, the Dane, (when
in England to copy out the poem of <i>Beowulf</i> for publication
at Copenhagen), gave a very flattering testimony to Forster's
notes, in <i>Bibliotheca Topographica</i>, vol. ix. p. 891. <i>et
seq.</i>, though I believe he subsequently much modified it. Our
own writers who had to remark upon the subject, Sharon Turner, and
Wheaton, in his <i>History of the Northmen</i>, may be excused from
concurring in an opinion in which they had only a verbal interest.
Professor Ingram, in his translation of <i>Othere's Voyage</i>
(Oxford, 1807, 4to. p. 96. note), gives the following rather
singular deduction for the appellation: Quenland was the land of
the Amazons; the Amazons were fair and white-faced, therefore
<i>Cwen-Sae</i> the White Sea, as Forster had deduced it: and so,
having satisfied himself with this kind of Sorites, follows pretty
closely in Forster's wake. But that continental writers, who took
up the investigation avowedly as indispensable to the earliest
history of their native countries, should have given their
concurrence and approval so easily, I must confess, astonishes
me.</p>
<p>Dahlman, whilst Professor of History at Kiel, felt himself
called upon by his situation to edit and explain this work to his
countrymen more detailedly than previously, and at vol. ii. p. 405.
of the work cited by Mr. Singer gives all Alfred's original
notices. I shall at present only mention his interpretation of
<i>Quen Sae</i>, which he translates <i>Weltmeer</i>; making it
equivalent to the previous <i>Garseeg</i> or <i>Oceanus</i>. He
mentions the reasonings of Rask and Porthan, of Abo, the two
exceptions to the general opinion (which I shall subsequently
notice), without following, on this point, what they had previously
so much more clearly explained. The best account of what had
previously been done on the subject is contained in Beckmann's
<i>Litteratur der alten Raisen</i> (s. 450.); and incidental
notices of such passages as fall within the scope of their works,
are found in Schl&ouml;zer's <i>Allgemeine nordische
Geschichte</i>, Thummann's <i>Untersuchungen</i>, Walch's
<i>Allgemeine Bibliothek</i>, Sch&ouml;ning's <i>Gamle nordishe
Geographie</i>, Nyerup's <i>Historisk-statistik Skildering i aeldre
og nyere Tider</i>, in Sprengel's <i>Geschichte</i>, and by
W&ouml;rbs, in Kruse's <i>Deutsche Alterth&uuml;mer</i>. Professor
Ludw. Giesebrecht published in 1843, at Berlin, a most excellent
<i>Wendische Geschichte</i>, in 3 vols. 8vo., but his inquiries
concerning this Periplus (vol. iii. p 290) are the weakest part of
his work, having mostly followed blindly the opinions to which the
great fame and political importance of Dahlman had given full
credence and authority. He was not aware of the importance of
Alfred's notices for the countries he describes, and particularly
for the elucidation of the vexed question of Adam of Bremen's
<i>Julin</i> and Helmold's <i>Veneta</i>, by an investigation of
Othere's <i>Schiringsheal</i>, and which I endeavoured to point out
in a pamphlet I published in the German language, and a copy of
which I had the pleasure of presenting, amongst others, to
Professor Dahlman himself at the Germanisten Versammlung at
L&uuml;beck in 1847. To return, however, to the <i>Cwena land</i>
and <i>sae</i>, it is evident that the commentators, who are
principally induced by their bearings to Sweon land to look upon
the latter as the White Sea, have overlooked the circumstance that
the same name is found earlier as an arm of the Wendel or
Mediterranean Sea; and it is evident that one denomination cannot
be taken in a double meaning; and therefore, when we find Alfred
following the boundaries of Europe from Greece, "Crecalande ut on
&thorn;one Wendelsae &THORN;nord on &thorn;one Garsaege pe man Cwen
sae haet", it is certain that we have here an arm of the Wendel Sea
(here mistaken for the ocean) that runs from Greece to the north,
and it cannot also afterwards be the White Sea. It will be
necessary to bring this, in conformity with the subsequent mention
of <i>Cwen-Sae</i>, more to the northward, which, as I have just
said, has been hitherto principally attended to.</p>
<p>In Welsh topography no designation scarcely recurs oftener than
<i>Gwent</i> (or, according to Welsh pronunciation, and as it may
be written, <i>Cwent</i>) in various modifications, as Gwyndyd,
Gwenedd, Gynneth, Gwynne, &amp;c. &amp;c.; and on the authority of
Gardnor's <i>History of Monmouthshire</i> (Appendix 14.), under
which I willingly cloak my ignorance of the Welsh language, I learn
that <i>Gwent</i> or <i>Went</i> is "spelt with or without a
<i>G</i>, according to the word that precedes it, according to
certain rules of grammar in the ancient British language, and that
<i>Venedotia</i> for North Wales is from the same root." The author
might certainly have said, "the same word Latinized." But exactly
the same affinity or identity of names is found in a locality that
suits the place we are in search of: in an arm of the Mediterranean
stretching from Greece northwards; viz. in the Adriatic, which had
for its earliest name <i>Sirus Venedicus</i>, translated in modern
Italian into <i>Golfo di Venezia</i>.</p>
<p>Of the multitudes of authorities for this assumption I need only
mention Strabo, who calls the first settlers on its northern end
(whence the whole gulph was denominated) [Greek: Everoi]; or Livy,
who merely Latinizes the term as <i>Heneti</i>, lib. i. cap. i.,
"Antenorem cum multitudine Henetum." With the fable of Antenor and
his Trojan colony we have at present no further relation. The name
alone, and its universality at this locality, is all that we
require. I shall now show that we can follow these Veneti (which,
that it is a generic name of situation, I must now omit to prove,
from the compression <span class="pagenum"><a name="page179" id=
"page179"></a>{179}</span> necessary for your miscellany) without a
break, in an uninterrupted chain, to the north, and to a position
that suits Alfred's other locality much more fitting, than the
White Sea. The province of <i>Vindelicia</i> would carry us to the
Boden See (Lake of Constance), which Pomponius Mela, lib. iii. cap.
i. ad finem, calls <i>Lacus Venedicus</i>. This omitting the modern
evidences of this name and province in Windisch-Gr&auml;tz,
Windisch-Feistriz, &amp;c. &amp;c., brings us sufficiently in
contact with the Slavonic and Wendic people of Bohemia to track the
line through them to the two Lausitz, where we are in immediate
proximity to the Spree Wald. There the Wends (pronounce
<i>Vends</i>) still maintain a distinct and almost independent
community, with peculiar manners, and, it is believed, like the
gypsies, an elected or hereditary king; and where, and round
L&uuml;chow, in Hanover, the few remnants of this once potent
nation are awaiting their final and gradual absorption into the
surrounding German nations. Whenever, in the north of Germany, a
traveller meets with a place or district ending in <i>wits</i>,
<i>itz</i>, <i>pitz</i>, &amp;c., wherever situate, or whatever
language the inhabitants speak, he may put it down as originally
Wendish; and the multitude of such terminations will show him how
extensively this people was spread over those countries.
Itzenplitz, the name of a family once of great consequence in the
Mark of Brandenburg is ultra-Wendish. It will, therefore, excite no
wonder that we find, even in Tacitus, Veneti along their coasts and
Ptolemy, who wrote about a century and a half later than Strabo or
Livy, seems to have improved the terminology of the ancients in the
interval; for, speaking of the Sarmatian tribes, he calls these
Veneti [Greek: Ouenedai par holon ton Ouenedikon kolpon]. Here we
find the truest guide for the pronunciation, or, rather, for the
undigammaising of the Latin <i>V</i> and the Welsh <i>W</i>, as
<i>Ouenetoi</i>, which is proved in many distant and varying
localities. St. Ouen, the Welsh Owen and Evan, and the patron saint
of Rouen, no doubt had his name (if he ever existed at all) coined
from the French Veneti of Armorica, amongst which he lived; and
when foreigners wish to render the English name <i>Edward</i> as
spoken, they write <i>Edouard</i> and Robert the Wizzard, the
Norman conqueror of Sicily and Apulia, has his name transformed, to
suit Italian ears, into <i>Guiscard</i>, and as William into
<i>Gulielmi</i>. Thus, therefore, the whole coast of Prussia, from
Pomerania, as far, perhaps, as known, and certainly all the present
Prussia Proper, was the <i>Sinus Venedicus</i>, Ptolemy's [Greek:
kolpon]; and this was also Alfred's Cwen-Sae, for the north. I
admit that when Alfred follows Orosius, he uses <i>Adriatic</i> for
the <i>Golfo de Venezia</i>, but when he gives us his independent
researches, he uses an indigenous name. Professor Porthan, of Abo
in Finland, published a Swedish translation, with notes, of the
<i>Voyages of Othere and Wulfstan</i> in the <i>Kongl. Vitterhets
Historie och Antiquitet Academiens Handlingar, sjette Delen</i>.
Stockholm, 1800, p. 37-106., in which he expressly couples Finland
with Cwenland; and, in fact, considering the identity of
<i>Cwen</i> and <i>Ven</i>, and the convertibility of the <i>F</i>
and <i>V</i> in all languages, <i>Ven</i> and <i>Fen</i> and
<i>Cwen</i> will all be identical: but I believe he might have
taken a hint from Buss&aelig;us, who, in addition to his note at p.
13., gives at p. 22. an extract from the <i>Olaf Tryvassons
Saga</i>, where "Finnland edr Quenland" (Finland or Quenland) are
found conjoined as synonyms. Professor Rask, who gives the original
text, and a Danish translation in the <i>Transactions of the
Shandinavish Litteratur Selkskab</i> for 1815, as "Otter og
Wulfstans Korte Reideberetninger," &amp;c., though laudatory in the
extreme of Porthan, and differing from him on some minor points,
yet fully agrees in finding the Cwen-Sea within the Baltic: and he
seems to divide this inland sea into two parts by a line drawn
north and south through Bornholm, of which the eastern part is
called the Cwen or Serminde, or Samatian Sea.</p>
<p>Be that as it may, the above is one of a series of deductions by
which I am prepared to prove, that as the land geography of Germany
by Alfred is restricted to the valleys of the Weichsel (Wisle), the
Oder, the Elbe, and the Weser, so the sea voyages are confined to
the debouchures of such of these rivers as flow into the Baltic.
This would give a combined action of purpose to both well suited to
the genius of the monarch and the necessities of an infant trade,
requiring to be made acquainted with coasts and countries
accessible to their rude navigation and limited commercial
enterprise. So prudent a monarch would never have thought of noting
down, for the instruction and guidance of his subjects and
posterity, the account of a voyage which even now, after an
interval of ten centuries of continued nautical improvements, and
since the discovery of the compass, is not unattended with danger,
nor accomplished in less than a year's time wasted.</p>

<h3>REMARKABLE PROPOSITION CONCERNING IRELAND.</h3>
<p>The following passage, which contains a curious proposition
relating to Ireland, will probably be new and interesting to many
readers of "NOTES AND QUERIES," since the book from which I extract
it is a scarce one, and not often read. Among the many various
schemes that have of late been propounded for the improvement of
our sister country, this is perhaps not the least remarkable, and
shows that the <i>questio vexata</i>, "What is to be done with
Ireland?" is one of two centuries' standing. James Harrington, in
his <i>Oceana, the Introduction</i>, <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page180" id="page180"></a>{180}</span> (pp. 35, 36., Toland's
Edition, 1700), speaking of Ireland under the name of Panopea,
says,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Panopea, the soft Mother of a slothful and pusillanimous
people, is a neighbor Iland, antiently subjected by the Arms of
<i>Oceana</i>; since almost depopulated for shaking the Yoke, and
at length replanted with a new Race. But (through what virtues of
the Soil, or vice of the Air, soever it be), they com still to
degenerat. Wherfore seeing it is neither likely to yield men fit
for Arms, nor necessary it should; it had bin the Interest of
<i>Oceana</i> so to have dispos'd of this Province, being both rich
in the nature of the Soil, and full of commodious Ports for Trade,
that it might have bin order'd for the best in relation to her
Purse, which, in my opinion (if it had been thought upon in time),
might have bin best don by planting it with <i>Jews</i>, allowing
them their own Rights and Laws; for that would have brought then
suddenly from all parts of the World, and in sufficient numbers.
And though the <i>Jews</i> be now altogether for merchandize, yet
in the Land of <i>Canaan</i> (except since their exile, from whence
they have not bin Landlords), they were altogether for Agriculture,
and there is no cause why a man should doubt, but having a fruitful
Country and excellent Ports too, they would be good at both.
<i>Panopea</i> well peopled, would be worth a matter of four
millions of dry rents; that is besides the advantage of the
Agriculture and Trade, which, with a Nation of that Industry, coms
at least to as much more. Wherfore <i>Panopea</i> being farm'd out
to the Jews and their Heirs for ever, for the pay of a provincial
Army to protect them during the term of seven years, and for two
millions annual Revenue from that time forward, besides the customs
which would pay the provincial Army, would have bin a bargain of
such advantage both to them and this Commonwealth, as is not to be
found otherwise by either. To receive the <i>Jews</i> after any
other manner into a Commonwealth, were to maim it; for they of all
Nations never incorporat, but taking up the room of a Limb, are no
use or office to the body, while they suck the nourishment which
would sustain a natural and useful member."</p>

<p>The derivation of this word has been so strenuously and ably
discussed by the contending parties in your pages, that I have no
intention of interfering (non nostrum tantas componere lites)
further than to furnish a few materials bearing on the subject,
which may not have come under their notice.</p>
<p>It seems uncertain whether <i>Newes</i> was considered by our
ancestors <i>plural</i> or <i>singular</i>. Resolute John Florio is
sadly inconsistent in his use of it: in his <i>World of Wordes</i>,
ed. 1598, we have:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<i>Nova</i>, newe, fresh, a noueltie, a <i>newe report</i>.</p>
<p>"<i>Novella</i>, a tale, a nouell, a noueltie, a discourse, <i>a
newes</i> a message."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Queen Anna's <i>World of Wordes</i>, 1611:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<i>Nova</i>, a noueltie, <i>a new report</i>.</p>
<p>"<i>Novella, a tiding, or newes</i>.</p>
<p>"<i>Novellante</i>, a teller of <i>newes</i> or
<i>tidings</i>."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here we have <i>newes</i> treated both as <i>singular</i> and
<i>plural</i>! while we have <i>tiding</i> as the singular of
<i>tidings</i>, a form which, from long disuse, would now appear
strange to us. In the following extract from Florio's very amusing
book of Dialogues, <i>Second Frutes</i>, 1591, he makes
<i>newes</i> decidedly plural:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<i>C</i>. What doo they say abroade? what <i>newes</i> have
you, Master Tiberio? <i>T</i>. Nothing that I know; can you tell
whether the post be come? <i>C</i>. No, Sir; they saye in the
Exchange that the great Turke makes great preparation to warre with
the Persian. <i>T</i>. 'Tis but a deuice; <i>these be newes</i>
cast abroade to feede the common sorte, I doo not beleeue them....
<i>C</i>. Yea, but <i>they</i> are written to verie worshipful
merchants. <i>T</i>. By so much the lesse doo I beleeue them; doo
not you know that euerie yeare <i>such newes are</i> spreade
abroade? <i>C</i>. I am almost of your minde, for I seldome see
these written reports prove true. <i>T</i>. Prognostications,
<i>newes</i>, deuices, and letters from forraine countries (good
Master C&aelig;sar), are but used as confections to feed the common
people withal. <i>C</i>. A man must give no more credite to
Exchange and Powles' <i>newes</i> than to fugitiues promises and
plaiers fables."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Thomas's <i>Principal Rules of the Italian Grammer, with a
Dictionarie</i>, printed by Thomas Powell in 1562, but written in
1548, we have&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<i>Novella</i>, a tale, a parable, or a <i>neweltee.</i></p>
<p>"<i>Novelluzza</i>, an <i>ynkelyng</i>.</p>
<p>"<i>Novellare</i>, to tell tales or <i>newes</i>."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the title page of a rare little volume printed in 1616, we
have the adjective <i>new</i> in apposition with the substantive
<i>newes</i>, thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Sir Thomas Overburie his Wife, with new Elegies upon his (now
knowne) untimely death. Whereunto are annexed <i>New Newes</i> and
Characters written by himselfe and other learned Gentlemen. Editio
septima. London: printed by Edward Griffin for Lawrence Lisle,

<blockquote>
<p>"<i>Newes</i> from any-whence, or, <i>Old Truth</i> under a
supposal of <i>Noueltie</i>."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Chaucer uses for <i>the newe</i> and of <i>the newe</i> (sc.
fashion) elliptically. <i>Tiding</i> or <i>Tidings</i>, from the
A.-S. Tid-an, evidently preceded <i>newes</i> in the sense of
inteligence, and may not <i>newes</i> therefore be an elliptic form
of <i>new-tidinges</i>? Or, as our ancestors had
<i>newelt&eacute;</i> and <i>newelt&eacute;s</i>, can it have been
a contraction of the latter? If we are to suppose with Mr. Hickson
that <i>news</i> was "adopted bodily into the language," we must
not go to the High-German, from which our early language has
derived scarcely anything, but to the Neder-Duytsch, from the
frequent and constant communication with the Low Countries in the
sixteenth century. The following passages from Kilian's
<i>Thesaurus</i>, printed by Plantin, at Antwerp, in 1573, are to
the purpose, and may serve to show how the word was
formed:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<i>Nieuwtijdinge</i>, oft <i>wat nieuws</i>, Nouvelles, Nuntius
vel Nuntium."</p>
<p>"<i>Seght ons wat nieuws</i>, Dicte nous quelquechose de
nouveau, Recita nobis aliquid novi."</p>
<p>"<i>Nieuwsgierich, nygierich</i>, Convoiteux de nouveautez,

in the following words:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The taking away of warts, by rubbing them with somewhat that
afterwards is put to waste and consume, is a common experiment; and
I do apprehend it the rather, because of mine own experience. I had
from my childhood a wart upon one of my fingers; afterwards, when I
was about sixteen years old, being then at Paris, there grew upon
both my hands a number of warts (at least an hundred), in a month's
space; the English Ambassador's lady, who was a woman far from
superstition, told me one day she would help me away with my warts;
whereupon she got a piece of lard with the skin on, and rubbed the
warts all over with the fat side, and amongst the rest, that wart
which I had from my childhood; then she nailed the piece of lard
with the fat towards the sun, upon a post of her chamber window,
which was to the south. The success was, that within five weeks'
space all the warts went quite away, and that wart which I had so
long endured for company; but at the rest I did little marvel,
because they came in a short time and might go away in a short time
again, but the going of that which had stayed so long doth yet
stick with me. They say the like is done by rubbing of warts with a
green elder stick, and then burying the stick to rot in muck."</p>

<h3>MINOR NOTES.</h3>
<p><i>Capture of Henry the Sixth.</i>&mdash;At Waddington in Mytton
stands a pile of building known as the "Old Hall," once antique,
but now much indeed despoiled of its beauty, where for some time
the unfortunate king, Henry the Sixth, was concealed after the
fatal battle of Hexham, in Northumberland. Quietly seated one day
at dinner, "in company with Dr. Manting, Dean of Windsor, Dr.
Bedle, and one Ellarton," his enemies came upon him by surprise,
but he privately escaped by a back door, and fled to Brungerley
stepping-stones (still partially visible in a wooden frame), where
he was taken prisoner, "his legs tied together under the horse's
belly," and thus disgracefully conveyed to the Tower in London. He
was betrayed by one of the Talbots of Bashall Hall, who was then
high-sheriff for the West Riding. This ancient house or hall is
still in existence, but now entirely converted into a building for
farming purposes: "Sic transit gloria mundi." Near the village of
Waddington, there is still to be seen a meadow known by the name of
"King Henry's Meadow."</p>

described as having taken place "in <i>Lincolnshire</i>,"

"NOTES AND QUERIES," and invite some of your more learned readers

<p>Of the identity of the words <i>alarm</i> and <i>alarum</i>
there is no doubt. The verb <i>alarm</i> is spelt <i>alarum</i> in
old writers, and I have seen it so spelt in manuscripts of Charles
II.'s reign, but unfortunately have not taken a "Note." Dr. Johnson
says <i>alarum</i> is a corruption of <i>alarm</i>. Corruption,
however, usually shortens words. I cannot help having a notion that
<i>alarum</i> is the original word; and, though I may probably be
showing great ignorance in doing so, I venture to propound the
following Queries:&mdash;</p>
<p>1. How far back can the word <i>alarum</i> be traced in our
language, and how far back <i>alarm</i>?</p>
<p>2. Can it be ascertained whether the French took <i>alarme</i>
from our <i>alarm</i>, or we <i>alarm</i> from them?</p>
<p>3. Can any explanation be given of <i>alarum</i>, supposing it
to be the original word? Is it a word imitative of sound?</p>
<p><i>A l'arme</i>, instead of <i>aux armes</i>, adds to the
suspiciousness of this derivation.</p>

<h2>REPLIES.</h2>
<h3>SHAKSPEARE'S USE OF "DELIGHTED."</h3>
<p>Although Dr. Kennedy does not think I have discovered the source
from whence Shakspeare's word <i>delighted</i> is derived, I am
gratified to find that he concurs with me in drawing a distinction
between this and the more common word. His failure to convince me
is a source almost of regret, so happy do I regard the derivation
he proposes in the last passage cited. But in the passage from
<i>Measure for Measure</i>, it does not appear to me to express the
sense which I deduce from the context; and as I look upon the word
in question as the same in each of the three passages, I feel more
inclined to adhere to my view, that it is a word of English
manufacture, according to the analogy referred to. I express my
opinion with hesitation and there can be no doubt the question is
deserving of full and attentive consideration.</p>
<p>Strengthened, however, in my main purpose, which was to show
that Shakspeare did not use <i>delighted</i> in the ordinary sense
of <i>highly gratified</i>, I am better prepared to meet MR.
HALLIWELL. This gentleman does me no more than justice in the
remark, not expressed, though, I hope, implied, that I would not
knowingly make use of an offensive expression towards him or any
living man; and I appreciate the courtesy with which he has
sweetened the uncomplimentary things he has felt constrained to say
of me. I trust it will be found that I can repay his courtesy and
imitate his forbearance. As a preliminary remark, however, I must
say that MR. HALLIWELL, in his haste, has confounded the "cool
impertinence" for which I censured one editor, with the "cool
correction" which was made by another; and, moreover, has referred
the remark to <i>Measure for Measure</i>, which I applied to the
notes to the passage in <i>Othello</i>. As I have not yet learned
to regard the term "delightful" as an <i>active participle</i>, it
is evident that, however "cool" I may consider the correction, I
have not called it an "impertinence." But he has no mind that I
should escape so easily; and therefore, like a true knight-errant,
he adopts the cause without hesitation, as though to be first
satisfied of its goodness would be quite inconsistent in its
champion.</p>
<p>When I am charged with an "entire want of acquaintance with the
grammatical system" employed by Shakspeare, I might take exception
to the omission of the words "as understood by Mr. Halliwell," this
gentleman assuming the very point in question between us. I believe
he has paid particular attention to this subject; but he must not
conclude that all who presume to differ from him "judge
Shakspeare's grammar by Cobbett or Murray." And if I were disposed
to indulge in as sweeping an expression, I should say that the
remark excites a suspicion of the writer's want of acquaintance
with the spirit of Shakspeare's works. I do not think so, though I
think MR. HALLIWELL has formed his opinion hastily; and I think,
moreover, that before I have ended, I shall convince him that it
would not have been amiss had he exercised a little more reflection
ere he began. In the passage in <i>Othello</i>, I object to the
substitution of <i>delighting</i> or <i>delightful</i> for
<i>delighted</i>, as <i>weak</i> epithets, and such as I do not
believe that Shakespeare would have used. It was not as a
schoolmaster or grammarian, but in reference to the peculiar
fitness and force of his expressions, and his perfect acquaintance
with the powers of the English language, and his <i>mastery</i>
over it, that I called Shakespeare its greatest master.</p>
<p>But to return to the first passage I cited&mdash;that from
<i>Measure for Measure</i>,&mdash;MR. HALLIWELL will be surprised
to find that in the <i>only</i> remark I made <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page184" id="page184"></a>{184}</span> upon it
as it stands he actually agrees with me. I said that the passage
"in our sense of the term" is unintelligible. I still say so; and
he who attempts to mend it, or modernise the form, says so too. The
question next arises, Does he not mean <i>no system</i>, when he
says <i>system</i>? Otherwise, why does he say that Shakspeare uses
the passive for the active participle, when he explains the word
not by the active participle, but by an adjective of totally
different meaning? Is it not more likely that MR. HALLIWELL may
have misunderstood Shakspeare's system, than that the latter should
have used intelligible words, and precise forms of words, so at
random? And, moreover, does not the critic confound two meanings of
the word <i>delightful</i>; the one obsolete, <i>full of
delight</i>, the other the common one, <i>giving delight</i>, or
<i>gratifying</i>?</p>
<p>Now by a violent figure which Shakspeare sometimes uses,
<i>delighted may</i> mean <i>delightful</i> in the <i>former</i>
sense; perhaps, rather, <i>filled with delight</i>. The word then
would be formed directly from the noun, and must not be regarded as
a participle at all, but rather an ellipsis, from which the verb
(which may be represented by <i>give</i>, <i>fill</i>,
<i>endow</i>, &amp;c.) is omitted. Take, as an instance, this
passage in <i>Measure for Measure</i>:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"<i>Clau.</i> Death is a fearful thing!</p>
<p>"<i>Isa.</i> And <i>shamed</i> life a hateful."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The meaning here is not <i>life ashamed</i>, but <i>life covered
with shame</i>. In this sense MR. HALLIWELL, apparently without
knowing why, has adopted the term <i>delightful</i>; but then the
two succeeding words of his explanation, "sweet, pleasant", he
would appear to have taken at random from a dictionary, forgetting
that he was not using the word in its ordinary sense; for it is not
possible that he can suppose Shakspeare to have used the word in
the sense of the active participle. Now, though I do not think this
at all the expression that Shakspeare would use, it is undoubtedly
allowable as a general characteristic; but the word actually used
would appear to imply the result of a particular action, which
would have been productive of anything but delight. In short, as we
are agreed that the word <i>delighted</i> in the passage in
question in its present sense is unintelligible, so also are we, I
think, agreed that the substitute, if any, must be used in a
passive sense.</p>
<p>Now, with regard to the first instance furnished by MR.
HALLIWELL of the use of the passive for the active participle, if I
were sure that the delinquent were well out of hearing, and not
likely "to rise again and push us from our stools," I should be
disposed to repeat the charge of impertinence against the editor
who altered "professed" to "professing". The word <i>professed</i>
is one of common use, and in the present instance perfectly
intelligible. "To your bosom, <i>professed</i> to entertain so much
love and care for our father, I commit him," seems to express the
sense of the passage: a doubt is implied by the expression, but
there is a directness of insult in the term <i>professing</i> quite
inconsistent with the character of Cordelia.</p>
<p>"Becomed love" is love suited or fitted to the occasion. The use
of the passive participle is every way more appropriate than that
of the active, though the latter is more common now.</p>
<p>In the next instance, I have to observe that there is no such
verb as <i>to guile</i>. <i>Guile</i> is a noun; and "guiled shore"
is <i>guile-covered</i>, or <i>charactered shore</i>. According to
this rule, the modern word <i>talented</i>, that is,
<i>talent-endowed</i>, has been formed, it not having been
considered that licences are allowed in poetry that are unsuited to
ordinary language.</p>
<p>The passage next referred to is conditional, and I regard the
use of the passive participle here, too, as correct.</p>
<p>I have thus reduced MR. HALLIWELL'S list to that number which
usually forms the exception rather than the rule; and if accident,
misprint, error in copying, or other special circumstance be not
held sufficient to account for the single remaining instance, I
have then only to say that I prefer <i>deformed</i> to
<i>deforming</i>, as an epithet applied disparagingly to Time's
hand as more in accordance with Shakspeare's practice, who was not
in the habit of repeating the same idea, which, in the latter case,
would occur again in the word "defeatures" in the following
line.</p>
<p>MR. HALLIWELL may, doubtless find other instances, perhaps more
felicitous than these; at present, all I can say is that he has
failed to show that the use of the passive for the active
participle was common with Shakspeare. As to other variations
between the grammatical usage of Shakspeare's day and that of our
own, I call assure him that I am not quite so ignorant of the fact
as he imagines.</p>

<p>Some years before, another similar collection had been
published. The first vol. printed in 1620, and reprinted in 1624,
has this title:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Englische Comedien und Tragedien, d. i. Sehr sch&ouml;ne,
herrliche und ausserlosene, geist- und weltliche Comedi- und
Tragedi-Spiel (sic), sampt dem Pickelhering, welche wegen ihrer

St&auml;dten seynd agirt und gehalten worden, und zuvor nie im
Druck aussgangen."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The volume contains 10 plays. The 1, 2, 3, 5, and 10, are the
16, 17, 13, 10, and 12, of the collection of 1670. The other five
are the following:</p>
<div class="poem">

</div>
</div>
<p>The second volume was published in 1630, under the title
<i>Lieberkampff, oder ander Theil der Englischen Com&ouml;dien</i>:
it contains 8 plays. The 1st is the 21st of the collection of 1670,
with this addition:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Die Personen der Lustspiels sind: 1. Venus, <i>die stumme
Person</i>; 2. Cupido; 3. Jucunda, <i>Jungfraw</i>; 4. Floretus,
<i>Liebhaber</i>; 5. Balendus, <i>Betrieger</i>; 6. Corcillana,
<i>Kuplerin</i>; 7. Hans Worst.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The 2d is the 20th of the same collection, "mit 9 Personen,
worunter die lustige Person Schr&auml;m heisst."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>3. Comoedia von Prob getrewer Lieb, mit 11 Personen, worunter
auch eine allegorische, der Traum ist.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The 4th is the 18th, "mit 9 Personen, worunter die lustige
Schampilasche <i>Lean Potage</i> heisst."</p>
<p>The four remaining are operas, without particular titles.</p>
<p>Ebert (<i>Bibliogr. Lexicon</i>, N. 5064.), speaking of these
collections, says, "the plays they are composed of are not
translations from the English," but, "as it appears," German
original works.</p>
<p>I am at a loss to understand how that bibliographer, generally
so exact, did not recognise at least five comedies of
Moli&egrave;re. MR. BOLTON CORNEY will, I wish and hope, point out
the originals&mdash;English, Italian, and, I suppose,
Spanish&mdash;of some others.</p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;The Query (Vol. i., p. 185.) concerning the name of

English comedians performing in Germany at the close of the
sixteenth and commencement of the seventeenth centuries: a subject

<h3>ACHILLES AND THE TORTOISE.</h3>
<h4>(Vol. ii., p. 154.)</h4>
<p>This paradox, whilst one of the oldest on record (being
attributed by Aristotle to Zeus Eleates, B.C. 500), is one of the
most perplexing, upon first presentation to the mind, that can be
selected <span class="pagenum"><a name="page186" id=
"page186"></a>{186}</span> from the most ample list. Its professed
object was to disprove the phenomenon of motion; but its real one,
to embarrass an opponent. It has always attracted the attention of
logicians; and even to them it has often proved embarrassing
enough. The difficulty does not lie in proving that the conclusion
is absurd, but in <i>showing where the fallacy lies</i>. From not
knowing the precise kind of information required by [Greek:
Idiotaes], I am unwilling to trespass on your valuable space by any
irrelevant discussion, and confine myself to copying a very
judicious note from Dr. Whateley's <i>Logic</i>, 9th edit. p.
373.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"This is one of the sophistical puzzles noticed by Aldrich, but
he is not happy in his attempt at a solution. He proposes to remove
the difficulty by demonstrating that in a certain given time,
Achilles <i>would</i> overtake the tortoise; as if any one had ever
doubted <i>that</i>. The very problem proposed, is to surmount the
difficulty of a seeming demonstration of a thing palpably
impossible; to show that <i>it is</i> palpably impossible, is no
solution of the problem.</p>
<p>"I have heard the present example adduced as a proof that the
pretensions of logic are futile, since (it was said) the most
perfect logical demonstration may lead from true premises to an
absurd conclusion. The reverse is the truth; the example before us
furnishes a confirmation of the utility of an acquaintance with the
syllogistic form, <i>in which form the pretended demonstration in
question cannot be exhibited</i>. An attempt to do so will evince
the utter want of connection between the premises and the
conclusion."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What the Archbishop says is true, and it disposes of the
question as one of "Formal Logic:" but yet the form of the sophism
is so plausible, that it imposes with equal force on the "common
sense" of all those who repose their conclusions upon the
operations of that faculty. With them a different procedure is
necessary; and I suspect that if any one of the most obstinate
advocates of the sufficiency of common sense for the "balancing of
evidence" were to attempt the explanation of a hundred fallacies
that could be presented to him, he would be compelled to admit that
a more powerful and a more accurate machine would be of advantage
to him in accomplishing his task. This machine the syllogism
supplies.</p>
<p>The discussion of Gregory St. Vincent will be found at pages
101-3. of his <i>Opus Geometricum</i>, Antw., 1647 fol. The
principle is the same as that which Aldrich afterwards gave, as
above referred to by Dr. Whateley. I can only speak from memory of
the discussion of Leibnitz, not having his works at hand; but I am
clear in this, that his principle again is the same. [Greek:
Idiotaes] is in error, however, in calling St. Vincent's "a
geometrical treatment" of it. He indeed uses lines to represent the
spaces passed over; and their discussion occurs in a chapter on
what is universally (but very absurdly) called "geometrical
proportion." It is yet no more <i>geometrical</i> than our
school-day problem of the basket and the hundred eggs in Francis
Walkinghame. Mere names do not bestow character, however much
<i>philosophers as well as legislators</i> may think so. All
attempts of the kind have been, and must be, purely numerical.</p>

<p><i>Achilles and the Tortoise.</i>&mdash;Your correspondent will
find references in the article "Zeno (of Elea)" in the <i>Penny
Cyclop&aelig;dia</i>. For Gregory St. Vincent's treatment of the
problem, see his <i>Quadratara Circuli</i>, Antwerp, 1647, folio,
p. 101., or let it alone. I suspect that the second is the better
reference. Zeno's paradox is best stated, without either Achilles
or tortoise, as follows:&mdash;No one can go a mile; for he must go
over the first half, then over half the remaining half, then over
half the remaining quarter; and so on <i>for ever</i>. Many books
of logic, and many of algebra, give the answer to those who cannot
find it.</p>

<h3>REPLIES TO MINOR QUERIES</h3>
<p>"<i>Barum</i>" and "<i>Sarum</i>" (Vol. ii., p. 21.)&mdash;The
formation of the first of these words has not yet been accounted
for. I must premise my attempt to supply an explanation by
admitting that I was not aware it was in common use as a
contraction for Barnstaple. I think it will be found that the
contracted form of that name is more usually "Berdest," "Barnst".
In trying further to contract the word, the two last letters would
be omitted, and it would then be "Bar&ntilde;", with the circumflex
showing the omission of several letters. Having reduced it to this
state, an illiterate clerk would easily misread the circumflex for
the plain stroke "-," expressing merely the omission of the letter
"m", and, perhaps ignorant of the name intended, think it as well
to write at full length "Barum."</p>
<p class="author">J. Br.</p>
<p><i>Countess of Desmond</i> (Vol. ii., p. 153.)&mdash;It is
stated in Turner's <i>Sacred History</i>, vol. iii. p. 283., that
the Countess of Desmond died in 1612, aged 145. This is, I presume,
the correct date of her decease, and not 1626 as mentioned by your
querist K.; for in Lord Bacon's <i>History of Life and Death</i>,
originally published in 1623, her death is thus alluded
to:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The Irish, especially the Wild Irish, even at this day, live
very long. Certainly they report that within these few years the
Countess of Desmond lived to a hundred and forty years of age, and
bred teeth three times."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The manner of her death is recorded by Mr. Crofton Croker, in
his agreeable volume of <i>Researches in the South of Ireland</i>,
4to. London, 1824. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page187" id=
"page187"></a>{187}</span> Speaking of Drumana, on the Blackwater,
a little above Youghall, as the "reputed birth-place of the
long-lived Countess of Desmond," he says,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In this part of the country, her death is attributed to a fall
whilst in the act of picking an apple from a tree in an orchard at
Drumana."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the <i>Olla Podrida</i>, a volume of miscellanies, printed
for private distribution, by Mr. Sainthill of Cork, there is a
portrait of the "old countess," from an etching made by Mr. Crofton
Croker (if I mistake not) in his early days.</p>

<p><i>Michael Servetus, alias Reves.</i>&mdash;The manuscript, the
character and fate of which S.H. (Vol. ii., p. 153.) is anxious to
investigate, contained books iii.-vii., inclusive, of the work of
Servetus <i>De Trinitate</i>; and as these fragments differed
somewhat from the printed text, they were probably the first, or an
early, draft (not necessarily in the author's handwriting) of part
of the <i>Christianismi Restitutio</i>. The purchaser of this MS.,
at the sale of Du Fay's library in Paris in the year 1725, was the
Count de Hoym, ambassador to France from Poland. I beg to refer
your correspondent to pp. 214-18. of the <i>Historia Michaelis
Serveti</i>, by Henr. ab Allwoerden, published with Mosheim's
approbation, Helmstad 1728.</p>
<p>Both a "Note" and a "Query" might be founded on a memorable
passage in the fifth book <i>De Trinitate</i>, in which Servetus,
long before Harvey, explains the circulation of the blood.</p>
<p class="author">R.G.</p>
<p><i>Caxton's Printing-office</i> (Vol. ii., pp. 99. 122.
142.).&mdash;It is a pity MR. NICHOLS did not take the trouble to
see, and, having seen, to notice in his first communication, that
Abbot Islip was mentioned in the passage from Stow's <i>Survey</i>
cited by MR. RIMBAULT. As that gentleman quotes from, I believe,
the second edition of the <i>Survey</i>, I may be allowed to doubt,
until it is clearly shown, that "Islip's name has been introduced
by the error of some subsequent writer." But supposing this to be
so, it would in no way affect the only question which is material,
Who was Caxton's patron? nor touch the accuracy of the <i>Life of
Caxton</i>, which MR. NICHOLS seems desirous of impeaching. I am
anxious to point this out, because I feel it right to vindicate to
the utmost, where they deserve it, useful works, which, like the
little volume I am writing of, are published at a price that
ensures for them a circulation of almost unlimited extent.</p>
<p class="author">ARUN.</p>
<p><i>Somagia</i> (Vol. ii., p. 120.).&mdash;This is the plural of
"somagium," "summagium," and means "horse-loads." It is a word
frequently found in documents relating to agrarian matters, and may
signify the load packed upon the horse's back (whence the name
"sumpter-horse"), or in a cart drawn by a horse. MR. SANSOM will
find a full explanation of the derivatives of its root, "sagma," at
p. 50., vol. vii., of Ducange.</p>

<p><i>Various Modes of Interment among the Ancients</i> (Vol ii.,

their inhumanity.</p>

<p>The appendix to this work may be consulted for this, and yet
greater violations of the law of nature and nations.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Hyde accounts for the Persians who embraced the religion of the
Magi not having adopted the two contrivances of corporal
dissolution prevalent among civilised nations&mdash;cremation or
burning, and simple inhumation&mdash;by the superstitious reverence
with which they regarded the four elements. Sir T. Browne remarks
that similar superstitions may have had the same effect among other
nations.</p>
<p>Of the post-mortem <i>punishments</i> described by Ducange, the
former was the customary sepulture of the Troglodit&aelig;; the
latter corresponds with the rite of some of the Scythians recorded
by Statius:</p>

<p>I shall be obliged if you or a correspondent disposed "not only
to teach but to communicate," will kindly throw light on a passage,

<p><i>Guy's Porridge-pot</i> (Vol. ii., p. 55.).&mdash;Your
correspondent is quite correct, when he says "neither the armour
nor pot belonged to the noble Guy." He would have been a <i>guy</i>
if he <i>had</i> worn the armour, seeing that it was made for a
horse, and not for a man.</p>
<p>What the stout old lady who showed us the "relics of old Guy" in
1847 called "Guy's breastplate," and sometimes his helmet! is the
"croupe" of a suit of horse armour, and "another breastplate" a
"poitrel." His porridge-pot is a garrison <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page188" id="page188"></a>{188}</span> crock of
the sixteenth century, used to prepare "sunkits" for the retainers;
and the fork a military fork temp. Hen. VIII.</p>
<p>The so called "Roman swords" are "anelaces," and a couteau de
chasse of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.</p>
<p>The "British weapon" is a hammer at arms temp. Hen. VIII., and
"the halbert" a black bill temp. Hen. VII. The only weapons
correctly described are the Spanish rapiers.</p>
<p>The shield with the "sight" is very curious; it weighs thirty
pounds, and is of the temp. of Henry VIII.</p>
<p>It is impossible to describe the horror of the old lady at our
doubting her version; she seemed to wonder the earth did not open
and swallow us for our heresy.</p>

an article, being a sketch of Dutch literature, in the <i>Foreign

extracted by your correspondent T.S.D. is the 4 Hen. VII. c. 3.,
which enacts that&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"No butcher shall kill any flesh within his scalding-house, or
within the walls of London, in pain to forfeit for every ox so

beasts in London." I believe, however, Bohun's reference will be
found to be the correct one. The statute in question has, I think,
never been repealed; but in the absence of abbatoirs, or other
proper provision for the slaughtering of cattle without the walls
of the city, it seems doubtful whether the <span class=

ordeigned y't no such slaughter of best shuld be used or had within
this cite," was no doubt 4 &amp; 5 Henry VII. c. 3., intituled "An
Act that no Butcher slea any Manner of Beast within the walls of
London." The penalty is only twelvepence for an ox or a cow, and
eightpence for any smaller animal. The act itself seems unrepealed,
but the penalties are too small at the present day to abate the
nuisance.</p>

<p><i>Clerical Costume</i> (Vol. ii., p. 22.).&mdash;Possibly the
answer to this Query may be found in the passage from Bacon's
<i>History of Life and Death</i>, in the third part of the
<i>Instauratio Magna</i>, which I copy below from Craik's <i>Bacon
and his Writings</i>, vol. iii. p. 45.:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Some report that they have found great benefit in the
conservation of their health by wearing scarlet waistcoats next
their skin and under their shirts, as well down to their nether
parts as on the upper."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the quantity of serge bought, as well as from the nature of
the material, I think it likely it might be required for the
purpose here noticed by Bacon, and not for an outer waistcoat.</p>

<p><i>Welsh Language; Armenian Language</i> (Vol. ii., p.
136.).&mdash;JARLTZBERG will find no Welsh dictionary with the part
reversed. I possess a dictionary in Welsh and English, in two
volumes, by Pugh, published in 1832, which is one of the best. The
one in two volumes by Walters is in English and Welsh, and is also
one of the best. The four volumes would make a good dictionary. The
best grammar is, I think, Pugh's. See the Welsh bookseller in
Holywell Street: I believe his name is Williams.</p>
<p>Father Chamick compiled the <i>History of Armenia</i> from the
historical works of several authors, which was published at Venice
in 1786; and in 1811 an abridgment thereof, which was translated by
Mr. Acdall, of Calcutta, in 1827. See Messrs. Allen and Co.'s
<i>Catalogue of Oriental Works</i>, at whose house these, and
translations of other works (particularly the <i>History of
Vartan</i> and the <i>Memoirs of Artemi</i>), may be procured. I
think JARLTZBERG will find a dictionary in Armenian and French. I
saw a notice of one a short time since. (See Bernard Quaritch.) In
1841, Peterman published at Berlin, <i>Porta Ling. Orient., sive
Elementa Ling. Syr., Chald., Arab.</i>, &amp;c. &amp;c., which I
think contains an Armenian grammar. See Williams and Norgate; also
a list of Klaproth's works.</p>
<p class="author">AREDJID KOOEZ.</p>
<p><i>Armenian Language</i> (Vol. ii., p. 136.).&mdash;In reply to
JARLTZBERG, I can answer that Lord Byron did not compose the
English part of Aucher's <i>Armenian and English Grammar</i>. A
very learned friend of mine was at St. Lazero, in Venice, and knew
both Aucher and Lord Byron. Lord Byron was taking lessons in
Armenian, and a few of his exercises were introduced into Aucher's
<i>Grammar</i>, which was written for Armenians to learn English,
with which language Aucher was quite familiar, having resided four
years in London. But a new <i>Armenian and English Grammar</i> has
recently been published. There is one, very rare, in Armenian and
Latin, and another in Armenian, modern Greek, and Italian. I have
just seen John Bunyan's <i>Pilgrim's Progress</i> in <i>vulgar</i>
Armenian, with plates, published at Smyrna; and the <i>Prayers of
St. Nierses</i>, in twenty-four languages, Venice, 1837, of which
Armenian is one. Several works in Armenian have been published at
Calcutta.</p>

<p><i>North Sides of Churchyards unconsecrated</i> (Vol. ii., p.
55.).&mdash;The strong preference given to the south side of the
churchyard is traceable to two principal causes; first and chiefly,
because the churchyard cross was always placed here; secondly,
because this is the sunny side of the churchyard. The cross, the
emblem of all the Christian's hopes, the bright sun shining on the
holy ground, figurative of the sun of righteousness, could not fail
to bring to mind the comforting assurance that they who slept
around would one day rise again. And as the greater part of the
congregation entered the church by the south and principal door,
another cause of the preference was the hope that the sight of the
resting places of those of their friends and neighbours who had
died in the communion of the church, might remind the survivors
each time they repaired to the house of prayer to remember them in
their supplications. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page190" id=
"page190"></a>{190}</span> There is not, however, I believe, the
slightest reason for considering that the north side of the
churchyard was left unconsecrated, nor do I think it possible that
such could ever be the case, inasmuch as all consecrated ground was
required to be fenced off from that which was unhallowed. But the
north side has always been considered inferior to the south. For
example;&mdash;excommunicated persons were at one time buried
outside the precincts of the churchyard, which, of course, would
not have been necessary if any part had been left unconsecrated,
nor are instances of this practice wanting since the
Reformation.<a id="footnotetag1" name="footnotetag1"></a><a href=
"#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a> And when discipline began to be
relaxed, and murderers were interred even within the church itself,
it was still on the north side.<a id="footnotetag2" name=
"footnotetag2"></a><a href="#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a> It is very
usual in small country parishes to find the north side of the
churchyard without a single grave, nor is it generally resorted to
until the south side is fully occupied. It would be difficult to
mention another instance of a prejudice so universal, existing so
long after the causes of it have mainly passed away.</p>
<p>I cannot conclude without expressing the extreme interest which,
though he seems not to be aware of it, attaches to the statement of
your correspondent, to the effect that he had on two occasions,
namely, on the Revel Sunday, and on another festival, observed the
game of football in a churchyard in the West of England. It is,
indeed, interesting to find that relics of a custom which, however
repugnant to our notions, was sanctioned by the highest authority
in the best days of our church, still linger in some of our rural
districts; thus amply bearing out the mention made by Bishop Peirs
more than two centuries ago, of the attachment of the people of the
west to, and "how very much they desired the continuance of," these
ancient celebrations. For the letter of the prelate, which was
addressed to Archbishop Laud, and for many valuable details with
respect to dedication festivals, and the observance of Sundays in
former times, I would refer those who take an interest in the
matter to the <i>Hierurgia Anglican&aelig;</i>.</p>

<p>"<i>Sir Hilary charged at Agincourt</i>."&mdash;Your
correspondent B.H.C, who, at Vol. ii, p. 158., inquires after the
author and answer to this charade, might leave easily ascertained
that the author was the late Mackworth Praed, and that the answer
is "Good-night." I believe your correspondent has been guilty of
some verbal inaccuracies, which makes the answer appear not so
pertinent to his version as it really is; but I have not the
original at hand. Some few years ago, the charade appeared in a
Cambridge paper, with a story about Sir Walter Scott having sent it
anonymously to Queen Adelaide. This was contradicted, and the real
author named in a subsequent number of the newspaper, and a
metrical solution given, amongst others, of the charade, with
which, though I believe I could recollect it, I will not trouble
the Editor of "NOTES AND QUERIES." I think the charade first
appeared in a cheap periodical, which was set on foot by the
parties concerned in <i>Knight's Quarterly</i>.</p>
<p class="author">J.H.L.</p>
<p>"<i>Sir Hilary charged at Agincourt</i>" (Vol. ii., p.

p. 469.: whether solved or soluble, I cannot say.</p>
<p>May I here express my concurrence in an opinion expressed in a

Petersburgh, in 1827. Mr. Heard also published a volume of
<i>Themes</i>, or <i>Exercises</i>, to his grammar, in the same
year. I am not acquainted with any other Russian grammar written in
English.</p>
<p>Hamoni&egrave;re published his <i>Grammaire Russe</i> at Paris
in 1817; and Gr<i>e</i>tsch (not Gr<i>o</i>tsch) published (in

years ago. A French translation appeared at the same place in 1828,
in 2 vols. 8vo., by Reiff.</p>
<p>In the <i>R&eacute;vue Encyclop&eacute;dique</i> for 1829, p.
702., some curious details will be found respecting, the various
Russian grammars then in existence. <i>J</i>appe's <i>Russian
Grammar</i> is possibly a misprint for <i>T</i>appe, whose grammar,
written in German, is a good one. Besides these, the titles of some
twenty other Russian grammars, in Russian, French, or German, could
be mentioned.</p>
<p>The anthologies published by Dr. Bowring, besides his Russian,
Dutch, and Spanish, are the Magyar, Bohemian, Servian, and
Polish.</p>
<p>Writing from Oxford, where the first Russian grammar ever
published was printed, as your correspondent JARLTZBERG correctly
states, perhaps it may interest him, or his friend, who, he says,
is about to go to Russia, to be informed (should he not already be
aware of the fact) that a "Course of Lectures on Russian
Literature" was delivered in this university, by Professor Trithen,
at Sir Robert Tayler's Institution, in the winter of 1849.</p>

<h2>MISCELLANEOUS.</h2>
<p>A very interesting contribution to our early national
literature, as well as to legendary history, has lately been
published by Dr. Nicolaus Delius of Bonn. He has edited in a small
octavo volume, published at a very moderate price, <i>Maistre
Wace's St. Nicholas</i>, an old French poem, by the poetical Canon
of Bayeux, whose <i>Roman de Rou et des Ducs de Normandie</i>,
edited by Pluquet, and <i>Roman de Brut</i>, edited by Le Roux de
Lincy, are, doubtless, familiar to many of our readers. The present
valuable edition to the published works of Maistre Wace, is edited
from two Oxford MSS., viz., No. 270. of the Douce Collection, and
No. 86. of the Digby Collection in the Bodleian: and to add to the
interest of the present work, especially in the eyes of English
readers, Dr. Delius has appended to it the old English metrical
life of <i>Saint Nicolas the Bischop</i>, from the curious series
of Lives and Legends which Mr. Black has recently shown to have
been composed by Robert of Gloucester.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
